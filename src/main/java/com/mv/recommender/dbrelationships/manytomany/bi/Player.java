     * The Player class has a one-to-many relationship with the Registration class as one player can register for many tournaments.
     * This can be modelled by the @OneToMany annotation.
     * Since the many side (Registration) is the owning side of a bidirectional relationship,
     * we will use the mappedBy attribute here (in the Player class) to specify that this is the inverse side of the relationship.
     * We are using cascade type ALL here because we want a playerâ€™s registrations to be deleted when the player record is deleted.
     * The player in the mappedBy attribute references the player field in the Registration class.
     * Hibernate looks at the @JoinColumn annotation on the player field to find the foreign key column.
